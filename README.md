# Sprint 7 project
# Project Description: For Sprint 7 Project, I was responsible for checking the response status code, parsing the response, and checking that the response body contained the expected data for GET, PUSH, PUT, and DELETE requests
# For this projest I used Postman, Visual Studio Code, and gitHub to create and run the tests, as well as Swagger to verify the correct response codes
# For this task, run the codes in Visual Studio Code for each request (GET, PUSH, PUT, DELETE). You should receive the response that all test were passed.
